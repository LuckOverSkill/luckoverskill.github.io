# Welcome to my dominion
Heya, I am Walter Moraschinelli. I am a content writer with a (very original, I know) passion for writing and literature. I also am fascinated by computers, but I will read just about anything that piques my curiosity, which is...most things.

On this website I plan to write about two things: 

- The stuff I learn
- My thoughts on random topics

It's a way to share my inputs with the world and practice writing. 

If you want to check out everything I have written about, you can see all of my posts on the [posts](/posts/) page. Or, if you prefer, you can browse the content by [tags](/tags). I will try to keep everything tidy, pinky promise!

And if you want to get in touch with me my contacts are on the sidebar. Please hire me to do any sort of writing. I am very smart.
