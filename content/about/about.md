Hey there, my name is Walter Moraschinelli, I am one of those people who got conned into the world of online writing. Let's see how long I last.

Beyond the online façade I'm a quiet 31 years old from Italy. I don't have much formal schooling. Or rather, I do have a lot in years, but those years were spent pursuing video games, so I'm playing catch-up.

I will add a picture of me on this page one day, I swear. If you are *really* curious about how I look and can't wait, you can see a pic of me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waltermoraschinelli).

If you're wondering how come I'm using an anime girl as a pfp, I don't have an answer. I just liked it.

This website will be a peaceful broadcast of my thoughts and learnings. Peaceful as in I will not insult anyone; I will voice my displeasure with things if it happens, but I'll try to create good stuff first and foremost.

I say as the first article I published is a 2k words rant against Google and the internet in general. Lol, lmao even.

But hey, now that I got that out of my system, I can work on better stuff!

Coming soon™:

- A list of [best posts](placeholder) (yes, I will decide which are my best posts, though I am installing analytics, so it'll be a popularity contest, at least partially)
- More posts, obviously
- Perhaps I'll link my Twitter one of these days, if I ever bother with using it
