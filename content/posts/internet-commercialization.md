I've been thinking about this topic a lot recently. Why is it that every website has become so commercialized?

Take social media. I see people posting the most stupid takes on Twitter to farm engagement. Without fail, they are Twitter Blue users who are there to "build and monetize their audience". Which really means posting caustic sentences to get support from people who believe "wow this person gets me!" 

On LinkedIn, I see fake stories posted all the time; when they aren't fake, the posts veneer into deranged territory. I saw a post yesterday that talked about putting in effort at a job. Among the fellating of the person publishing the job post, the following sentence appeared: "you have to put in 80 to take back 20". Why would anyone believe such nonsense? Who in their right mind would put in 80 to get 20? Literal scammer behavior. And yet, the post's engagement was soaring. 

Moving off social media and on more traditional websites, the problem persists, though under different clothes. Every % in extra revenue matters, so you see bloodthirsty marketers swimming towards any droplet of blood they can smell. 1% more sales by adding annoying pop-ups that ask the user to subscribe? Check. Plastering on every web page a banner that says "download now our FREE guide to MASTER sales"? Check. Spamming articles designed to get pushed on top of the search results despite being unreadable? Check.

The problem stems from how the internet has shaped up in recent years. To use an economic term, the incentives are misaligned. 

## The incentives problem
The word *incentive* comes from the latin *incentivum*, which means *something that sets the tune or incites*. It's something (could be anything) that pushes a person to act a certain way. For example, fines are an incentive; by assigning a monetary cost to parking where you shouldn't, the government is incentivizing you to park properly.

In the context of the internet, the incentives can be summed up like this: attract as many users and make them spend as much time as possible on your website. The reason behind this incentive is advertising money. Advertisers spend billions to place ads on websites, which then get shown to the targeted people. If the targeting is good, a part of these people will then visit the source of the ad and make a purchase. This way, the advertiser is happy because they got the sale; the website is happy because they got the ad money; and the user is (allegedly) happy for having bought something they wanted.

But it's easy to see how problematic this cycle is for everyone involved. Let's see what's wrong with each actor.

### Google
Google is the worst offender, and also the biggest reason behind the recent internet's downfall. The problem is two-fold: 

- It is a search engine, but also
- It is the biggest advertising company in the world

The two are at odd with each other. In theory, they are not, and you could see that they haven't been in practice either until recently. The theory goes like this: you show people what they are looking for through your search engine. But you also show them relevant ads that satisfy the need they searched for. If you offer good search results, the user doesn't mind the ads too much — in fact, sometimes they will offer them just what they were looking for.

But the cracks in the theory have started to show up in the real world. Since Google is a gargantuan ad network, it wants to serve as many ads as possible. But the more ads, the worse the search experience. Websites with lots of traffic are prime real estate for advertisers. Thus, they make up most of big G's revenue. But these websites also rely on Google's algorithm to keep them high up in the search results. Thus, Google is incentivised to prop up websites that get lots of traffic, even when they don't offer a good user experience.

Naturally, the people who work on Google Search will claim otherwise. I believe them; they are probably trying their best to deal with the hand they have. But Google's golden goose is their advertising network. Which means that ads have the priority.

Proof for my claim? Have you tried using YouTube recently? Every video is plastered with ads. And oh boy, what marvelous ads you find. I got obvious financial scams ads[^1][^2], NSFW ads[^3][^4], and downright illegal or dangerous[^5][^6] products.

Even more curious is that [in an academic paper they wrote in 1998, Larry and Sergey warned against what Google would become 20 years later](https://fairsearch.org/the-google-problem/). 

Quoting the paper:
>“Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers” (Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine, 1998)

Talk about self awareness.

While Google is the root of the problem, there are websites that don't need search engines at all. Yet, they are just as guilty of strangling the internet: social media.

### Social media
The problem with social media is that they want users to stay on them as much as possible. Again, it's a byproduct of needing advertisers' money to keep going.

But, they started as a benign phenomenon. Sites like MySpace and Tumblr were (the latter still is) about user expression. People shared what they liked, and found other people through mutual interests. 

Then came FaceBook. FaceBook also started with good intentions (or at least, that what the premise sounded like). Its goal was to let people keep in touch with family and friends on the internet. Originally, your feed would mostly be about what your friends were posting. Sure, you found the occasional funky take from your schizo uncle, but most of the content were innocent pictures and funny anecdotes. 

Nowadays all big social media platforms are so full of garbage they feel like an open-air dumping grounds. The problem is — you guessed it — incentives. When you want people to spend time on your social media website, the best way to do so is by promoting things that catch their attention. Me posting pictures of my new car might net 10 likes, but me posting about how much I hate immigrants will rack up so many views and comments from all sides that FaceBook/Twitter would be stupid not to boost my post.

Each social media platform pours oil on the fire its own way.

#### Twitter

Twitter is the king of idiotic takes posted for the sake of engagement. You could find in succession a post disparaging a race followed by a post disparaging another race. Then one post against women, followed by one against men. Then one against whatever scare du jour can get people riled up followed by a post stating the complete opposite. 

#### FaceBook

FaceBook has a similar problem but is way less open. If you have friends who actively use it, you can ask them for spectacular "boomer takes", usually posted by older people who casually spew hate as if they were talking at a pub with their friends.

#### Instagram

Instagram, being mostly about visuals, prefers a "show them things to lust after". As a male, opening its *Explore* page left me wonder if I didn't accidentally downloaded EscortAdvisor's app. Nevermind that everyone posts pictures and reels with filters and only posts the highlights of their life — that can't be good to watch all the time. But that's for another article.

#### LinkedIn
 
LinkedIn is a hub for narcissism, but it's even more subtle and vile than other platforms. People try to keep a professional demeanor while still wanting a piece of the engagement pie. The result is fake stories and posts that make absolutely no sense. You'll see people post one liners like "treat people with kindness" get thousands of likes. You'll see people lying on their past experiences (like pretending to be an "Harvard alumni" for having followed an online course by the university). But the worst behavior comes from those who excessively praise big corporations as if their lives depended on these gigantic brands. Pure cringe.

Check out the [Linkedin Lunatics](https://www.reddit.com/r/linkedinlunatics) subreddit for a few examples of lunatic behavior from LinkedIn users.

### Other commercial websites
On the lowest rung of the ladder we have assorted commercial websites. These include smaller hobbyist sites selling affiliate products and gigantic media sites like Forbes. Their breadwinners are your typical listicle articles like "top 10 best wireless earbuds in 2023". 

My main gripe with these websites is that many of them rank on top of the category purely because of their brand authority. You will never outrank Forbes in these categories, because Forbes is a juggernaut of a website. The same goes for Wired and other internet publications.

When you look into more obscure product reviews, you will often land on weird websites that offer no substance. They are mostly about copy-pasted specifics of the products with summary reviews scraped God only knows from where.

I understand that these websites aren't as awful as Google and social media, but they are part of the problem. They're merely making use of Google's incentive structure to prop themselves up and make money off it.  

## What can we do about it?
In an ideal world, we would stop using these services. The problem? It's not really feasible. Google has a good email service, Maps are irreplaceable (Apple maps could, but they require an Apple device), and logging into websites with a Google account is so smooth. YouTube is another killer service I don't see many people willing to drop, though you could peruse it without an account.

Plus, realistically, their search engine is still the best one, although people are starting to use it as a search engine for Reddit. By appending "Reddit" to your Google search, you can find real people discussing the topic, not bots or AIs living off scraped content.

Social media have somehow managed to embed themselves into our lives. It's not that I need FaceBook or Twitter to talk to my American relatives. It's that there's so much wonderful content (especially on Twitter), that dropping it would make my life marginally worse. And, at least as far as Twitter goes, it's not *that* hard to curate your feed so it only shows good stuff. I also use Instagram to keep up with a few friends. Personally, I avoid the parts that I find problematic about these services, but the problem is societal at this point, rather than individual.

As for the commercial websites, they live or die by Google's algorithm. They are horrendousl but I don't find them as pervasive.

Back to the ideal world dream, the best would be to stop relying so much on these behemots. Apparently, Google's authority is starting to erode; that's great. Social media feel a little more entrenched, but those are also starting to get looked at with suspicion. No one ever liked commercial websites, so let's keep that up, although sometimes they are a necessary evil.

I urge anyone who wants to use the internet and keep it free to do their best to skirt around these platform's main revenue sources. Here's what you can do without disrupting your life:

1. Install an adblocker. Personally, I will always recommend [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), but any one that works for you is fine
2. Drop Google Chrome. A big problem with Google is its quasi-monopoly status. The best browser out-of-the-box is probably [Brave](https://brave.com/) because it comes with a great adblocker and works fine without tinkering. Even if your grandma doesn't understand a thing beyond typing "weather in my town", Brave will keep her safe from phishing ads (yes, they exist) and dangerous pop-ups. Though I recommend dropping the crypto ads on the starting page (ironic, isn't it?)
3. Drop Gmail. This one's also a byproduct of Google's quasi-monopoly status. There are plenty of other email services that work just as well and don't exist to scan your data and use it to target you with ads. I paid for my own domain that also comes with an email service, but [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail)'s basic plan is free and works great
4. Block as much tracking as possible. Trackers follow you around the internet to profile what you do, with the goal of — surprise surprise — serve you targetted ads. It's like having a stalker take note on what you do and then use the information against you. Brave does an excellent job by default, but any browser will let you set up tracking protection in the settings. Look for the "Privacy" tab (this works on both Chromium-based browsers like Edge and Brave and Firefox-based ones like Firefox itself or Floorp) and set your tracking protection to "strict". Also, install [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) on your browser. If a website you absolutely need is broken due to these changes, consider setting up an exception for it

I am aware these are just a small droplet in the ocean, and that there are other companies doing creepy things with our data (I'm looking at you Microsoft, your telemetry is nothing short of deranged). But let's start with the least disruptive things first.
