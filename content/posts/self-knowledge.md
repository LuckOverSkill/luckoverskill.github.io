Knowledge is a fascinating topic. It's a given we give knowledge a high-value. So much that, at least in the Western world, we push kids through a decade plus of compulsory schooling.

But beyond the concept of education as teaching kids to be an effective adult in society, I want to focus on the actual value of knowledge and self-education.

I've started taking a serious interest in learning things in a more organized way. I've been a serious reader for the past few years, but my reading's been scattered around random fields. Granted, I gravitated towards a few specific fields — philosophy, writing and psychology mostly. But even then, I never studied any of those systematically. 

I only recently switched from an "anything goes" learning philosphy to a more focused one. Rather than read on all sorts of topic and hope mr brain sponge does the rest, I want to be more intentional in what I learn.

## What changed in my learning philosphy
So far I've taken a lax approach to learning. I've been following a few websites and newsletters, as well as reading a book about random topics. Usually those very books were suggested by the newsletters/blogs I follow.

This process gave me a solid foundation of knowledge on a vast array of topics. But it also never provided me with in-depth knowledge on anything. It was good enough to carry me through conversations with just about everyone. It was not enough to make me carry those conversations.

I recently stumbled upon this video:

{{< youtube nudbUMr9pXY >}}

Aside from the useful information on how to create a systematic learning course for yourself, a sentence from the video's author struck me. It said (paraphrasing) that all learning is, at least in part, self-directed. That is, you won't learn because of external resources, you will learn because you make a conscious effort of learning. Good external resources will shorten the path to knowledge, but you must still travel the path yourself.

That definitely rings true. It happens in school too. My classmates and I had access to the same resources. A few classmates did more with less, others had access to more, yet they performed worse. The only constant was the student. I put less effort in learning the material, thus I did worse than other classmates. Others took learning more seriously and seeked further resources. How well we did depended on how much we invested into learning. 

That brings me to the next question: how can I improve the way I steer my learning?

## Figuring our the personal learning quest
If it's true that all learning is self-directed, that means that knowing how to direct my learning is the axiom upon rests which the whole enterprise. 

First, I'd start by visiting the graveyard of things I started to learn but never committed to. 

These tombstones serve as a mark of what could have been if only I put more effort in these topics, instead of playing videogames or whatever else I was doing (it's probably videogames or web surfing). But also, the graves carry an inscription describing how their content came to be buried underground. It's usually a combination of "didn't progress fast enough", "moved onto a shinier subject", and "got lazy".

Next, once I have an idea of what went wrong, I'd go a little more in-depth with the reasons.

What is the problem with "didn't progress fast enough"? Were my expectations wrong? Did I sabotage myself to get out of learning a topic? Or maybe I didn't want to damage my ego by going through the humiliating ritual of admitting I don't understand something at first glance. 

What does "got lazy" truly mean here? Is it the kind of laziness that makes me endlessly scroll social media? Or is it the kind of laziness that comes as a result of me not putting effort in the first place? If I consider something unimportant I don't put effort into it. If I don't put effort into it I get lazy about it. 

And so on for each reason.

Last, I'd work on fixing the issues I figured out in the previous passages. That's where the video I linked above comes into play.

## What was going wrong?
During my analysis, it became painfully obvious what I got wrong. The way I approached self-learning was that I didn't direct it at all. I was like a small boat in a stormy sea. I could only hold on so long before the waves fagocitated me. 

I had to fortify my boat to be able to steer it wherever I wanted, rather than let outside elements take over control. 

To do that, I needed a blueprint. It never really occurred to me that I could build an entire course by myself. I was always of the idea that either you enrolled into a course (online or in-person), or you had to trust the internet to feed you the right information at the right time.

My thought process was that you needed some knowledge about the topic to individuate the right resources and order them properly. I even ventured as far as looking for resources at various level (e.g. beginner, intermediate, and advanced) on online forums and tried to pierce them together.

Even when I managed to successfully combine resources to create a coherent course, the success was based on luck. And it still failed the self-directed learning test. The material was good, my motivation was — at least at the beginning — high, but there was no intent in my learning, nor any end vision.

Let me illustrate the issue with an example.

Learning how to draw is a noble goal until you realize that there's no such thing as "drawing" that can be learned. Drawing is just putting squiggly lines (hopefully some straight ones as well) on a page to depict something. But since the world is infinitely complex, you can depict anything in an infinite number of ways. Nevermind that there are an infinite number of things to depict. Thus, the problem with the goal learning to draw is that it is not a goal, but an ideal. There was no endgame, there was no midgame either. There was only a nebulous and unattainable dream.

Thus, the need to build a tougher self-directed learning ship.

## Building my self-directed learning ship
I found the blueprint for an efficient self-directed learning ship by watching the youtube video I linked earlier.

But I still had some issues with it. First off, finding good information on the internet is getting harder and harder. Second, figuring out a way to organize information is complicated. Though this problem could easily be avoided by molding your course after a real-world university course.

My biggest ally in this endavour proved to be ChatGPT. If there is one thing ChatGPT is great at is synthetizing information and providing guidance for well-defined problems. It was exactly what I needed. 

Thus, I took it up upon myself to create my very own university course. I started with a current interest of mine: theology and Christian mysticism. It seemed the perfect topic: it piqued my interest, it happened to be something I hadn't yet dipped in, and it's somethng that I feel like I could teach about other people to really cement what I was learning.

So, first off I argued with ChatGPT about course syllabi. What should we include? What should we omit? How do we structure it?

Then, I asked it to create a template with all the necessary information I could fill myself, which it promptly did. Last, I discussed what to actually include in the syllabus, especially books-wise. Once the program gave me a list of books, I researched them on the internet to make sure they were at least related to the topic. Last, I searched  the name of a few of these authors on YouTube. Sure enough, I found a sequence of lectures either by those authors (for the contemporary ones), or university lectures on the works themselves.

Thus the [christian theology and mysticism syllabus](../syllabi/theology-mysticism-syllabus.md) was born.  It still wasn't in its final form, though. I'm not sure it is now either. I'm using it as a foundation, but things like "timeframe" and the course schedule are still up in the air. I'm following it well and I'm only in the 1st week, but i suspect I might run into complications in the future. The idea is to fine-tune it further as I follow along, and then use the blueprint for future courses.

With all the effort I went through with this, plus the effort that will go into actually following through with the program, the obvious questions becomes: why?

## The value of knowledge, or why bother with all this?
Why bother with learning all this stuff? Why of course, it's the love of knowledge combined with my current interests. There are a lot of things that interest me, and this seems like a good way to focus on a few ones, rather than let my mind get transported by the inherent chaos that lives on the internet. 

I don't plan to get anything specific out of following up with these courses. I see them as a way to grow as a person and deepen my understanding of the world. I have a few ideas for the next courses, should this one prove successful. Some will be on more abstract ideas, others on more practical matters. Still, it goes well with my personality and my life goals. 

Since the learning is self-directed, it happens purely because I want it to happen. If I had to take a guess at what's driving me, I think it's because of how it'll help me combine a thing I enjoy with others I want to get good at. There is a sort of intrinsic motivation I can't quite explain to others in the work I'm doing. 

My take is that if you've been struggling to find rational reasons to do something but always wanted to, you should go for it. Your gut instinct knows things your brain will never understand. Our brain is still a sort of a baby in evolutionary terms — not listening to other systems that have evolved for far longer is counterintuitive to me.

So, the value will come from a combination of acquiring knowledge, writing things from my content consumption, and following through a plan. 

Once I created the syllabus and started following the course, I still had a few questions about the ordeal. What is the learning actually about? And am I actually learning anything?

## Questioning the program's efficacy
I can't know if the program will work until I complete it. I talked at length about building and steering my ship, so that's the ultimate goal. Should the program help me steer the learning ship, then it'll have succeeded.

Regarding the question of whether or not I am learning, I have a few activities that include implementing what I learn. Discussing and writing about what I'm learning online will be the chief one. This website remains the main hub for any learning activity I conduct.

As for other quwestions like "is the program enjoyable enough to commit through it?" and "are you making use of the learning?", I can't give you an answer yet. Rest assured I will write a post about it eventually.

My expectations are high though.
