Productivity is a term that has been taking the internet by storm in recent years. But as with all terms that reach mainstream success in the content creation sphere, its meaning has been twisted.

The theory behind internet productivity is simple. You could be doing so much more with the time you're given. It's a Senecan-old message: *it's not that we have little time, it's that we squander lots of it*. You'll notice that this message finds its way onto everyone's consciousness sooner or later. It's been happening throughout the ages, but nowdays it's morphed into its own industry.

While commendable, the meaning of the message has been lost in favor of a more sellable version.

## What is productivity anyway?
Productivity is the ability to produce. It's in the name. You, as human being, have a wide range of skills. If you put them to use, you can create stuff. The more productive you are, the more you produce. The more you produce, the better.

So far, so good. But humans have been getting things done ever since we were hanging from trees, flinging shit at each other. 

What has changed since then? Why are we struggling so much now to do things? And how does that link to the productivity gurus' messaging?

What changed, everyone agrees, is the number of distractions available to us. My grandparents didn't even have a TV until the 70s. When your options for entertainment are so narrow, you have to get the most out of each one of them. Conversely, nowadays we have a millions ways of amusing ourselves (to death, if you're a Neil Gaiman fan). This abundance means we can peruse a source enough to tickle our brain, then move onto the next one. That way, we get maximum brain enjoyment, which feels the best in the moment. 

Here's how it works in non-scientific terms (not that I could produce a satisfying scientific explanation):

- The first few moments are the most enjoyable ones for the brain because of the novelty factor
- Enjoyment starts dropping hard after these moments
- "In moment" boredom sets in (that's when your thoughts starts drifting away)
- But if you keep up for long enough, the brain will quiet again and enjoy itself, though less than when it was in the novelty phase (we seldom get to this point nowadays)

The problem: modern platforms offer unlimited first-time highs. That way, you never have to feel a smidge of boredom. Fire up Instagram or Tik Tok on your phone and you get access to all the novelty in the world. Smoking hot girls, wonderful panoramas, delicious-looking food, and other alluring images will soothe your mind. 

How is anyone supposed to get things done with these premises? 

Fear not, for the internet has caught whiff of the problem, and concocted just the solution for you: the productivity trap. 

## The productivity trap
The productivity trap is a slick trick. It punches a few holes around the content prison to let light pass through. Except the light isn't the sun's — it comes from the content creator's flashlight. You are oblivious to this fact and wouldn't particularly care, since you are starved for any kind of light.

Are you getting out of the unlimited content prison? Clearly not. What you are doing is substituting a few bricks. Is it better than the original prison? Is it even different? Is this a [ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) situation? Are you just substituting every part of a prison with a new one?

The new prison might be marginally better, but it's still an oppressive prison. 

There are three main mechanisms baked into the trap:

- Note-taking systems
- Apps
- Content creators

All 3 mechanisms can suck you into a black hole of productivity. And what's worse — they all sustain one another.

### Note-taking systems

You discover the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or the [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) method, and they seem to instantly click. There's always been a gap between your interests and absorbing what you learn about them. These systems promise to bridge this gap, letting your notes resurface when you need them the most.

Then, you look into an app that makes implementing the system of your choice easy. Whatever you pick, you will take some time setting it up to your likings. 

You watch a nice person (or a few nice people) on YouTube showing you how they manage to be so productive. How are they benefitting from this? 
	 
I can't tell you the reasons driving each one of them. I'd wager that most begin out of a genuine desire to help, but end up perpetuating the problem. 

Still, they set up a vicious trap. And it's the kind of debilitating trap that damages you to keep you in.

They do so thanks to a few levers.

### Apps
Productivity apps are a solution in search of a problem. And they've managed quite well to create a problem. How much time is humanity spending on setting up pretty Notion pages, re-organizing Obsidian, or crafting to-do lists on Trello or Todoist that feel like they're coming out of the horn of plenty? 

Yet, we feel strangely drawn to these apps. There is something about them that *feels* like they can improve our productivity. My theory is that they seem like a step up from school, where we had notes scattered around notebooks, with no easy way of retrieving what we're looking for. 

Apps promise to let you do more with less time. What's there not to love? But that's not the real-world experience for plenty of people. Oftentimes, we're sucked into the productivity apps loop: 

- Find an app that looks good
- Watch a few videos on the app
- Finally start using it
- Watch a few more videos on setting it up properly
- Get bored with it after a month or two
- Go back to the first step, and repeat

It escapes me how all of this happens. Sure, procrastination and whatnot play a part. But there's something *so sexy* about these apps. You see creators pull off all sort of stunts with them. You read brilliant pieces of work, and notice their creators crediting their note-taking system. If you ever read *How to take smart notes* by Sönke Ahrens you must have noticed it too. Granted, it's a second-hand account; but the book makes it sound like it was McLuhann's note taking system doing the bulk of the work. 

My recommendation is to pick whatever app you like (or don't, I dropped them myself) and use it in the most basic form. Things like organization and design should grow organically as you use the app. Forcing a system into your organization because you read on the internet it improves your output is suboptimal. 

I would pick an app that:

- Works offline, so you can comb through your notes even when the internet is down
- Has a synchronize function, so that you can access your notes from whatever device you own
- Doesn't use a proprietary system for notes, so that you aren't locked into that app forever

I really liked Obsidian when I used apps, but it made me waste so much time on organizing my notes and linking them that I dropped it. I still think it's the best app of the bunch, but obviously it's not as good as, say, Notion in other aspects. 

Alternatively, you can use pen and paper. It just works. It might not be as searchable (but really, it takes a few seconds to get through an entire notebook) nor portable, but it's probably better in every other regard, including the part where you aren't looking at a screen. 

### Content creators
Content creators pull 3 levers to catch us into their content net:

1. Humans like to produce stuff. Thus, the idea of being able to produce more sounds great. There's also a delusion aspect. We are often *enamored with the idea of doing something*, rather than the actual doing. A lot of people who get into drawing or writing do so because they love the idea of creating something other people will appreciate. Creative endeavours are messy; their byproducts are not. But it's easy to spring the trap of "wow if only I could do that." 
2. Money. Money are one hell of an incentive. If you produce more you get better faster. In turn, you should become able to produce things that are good enough to sell. Who doesn't like that? Money is good. It buys us a roof over our head and food. And we can save it so we have a safe retreat, should the world strike us with a catastrophic event. 
3. Time. No, time isn't money; time is time. Let's play a game. How often will productivity gurus say phrases like "so you have more time for your hobbies", "so you can spend more quality time with your spouse/kids", "so you spend less time doing something you hate". Without fail, they tie your ability to produce more to what you strive for in your daily life. They aren't wrong per se, but what they are selling does not help you reach that goal.

I simply stopped watching these content creators. I have nothing against them per se — I just think that what they need to do to sustain their video production doesn't align with the intrinsic goal of what they talk about.

Incidentally, I just stumbled upon this video: 

{{< youtube 83ERdF4MMHo >}}

At around 1:30, he says this:

>you get on Twitter you get on YouTube and you see a lot of that stuff and it's become a battle of getting clicks and likes and Views versus putting out good information 

That's the unfortunate reality of content creation in 2023.

## How can I be productive then?
Obviously, we collectively struggle to be productive, else the entire productivity industry wouldn't exist. There are, in fact, hundreds of other avenues where a gain in productivity is promised as a collateral effect. It's evident we are trying our best to become more productive.

But at the end of the day, the problem isn't external. We don't struggle with productivity because we don't do productivity right. We aren't productive because we aren't producing. It is a matter of, to steal a certain brand's catchphrase, just doing it. I suspect David Goggins is onto something when he yells at the camera while he runs a bajillion miles at 4 AM. 

Yet, if it were so easy we would all be doing it. Our brain is very good at putting up a strenuous resistance when it refuses to collaborate. 

Some people will tell you it's all in your mind. They will tell you that your WHY (eugh) isn't strong enough. They will tell you that your mindset is not conductive to be productive. Only broken human beings struggle with productivity. How convenient that they can sell you the cure! Perhaps a coaching retreat, or a free eBook. 

Vampires, the lot of them. 

Sure, if you were a lion and went hungry, you would be productive. But we — thankfully — live in an era of abundance. Most of the activities that are pegged as productivity aren't a matter of life or death. That's why we don't treat them as such. 

So, if you still want to be productive, here's my epic secret formula you can steal:

- Just do it. Get into the arena with your brain. Wrestle it. It'll fight back fiercely for 10-15 minutes. If it hasn't quieted down by minute 20-30, drop the activity for the day. Obviously, this isn't always feasible — if you're at your job, you'll have to suck it up. And, no matter what you do, don't compare yourself to those internet dwellers who seem to have it all figured out
- Realize you're a flawed human being. Even the most brilliant and productive humans have struggled with getting things done throughout the ages. Having a few bad days is normal
- However, if the bad days start piling up, there might actually be something wrong with you. It might be as harmless as you not really caring about what you're doing. Remember the part about being enamoured with the end results? That is probably what's going on in this case. Or, if the work feels important to you and you actually want to do it, there might be something more sinister at play. I don't know you, so I can't help you more than this, sorry
- Stop searching for outside guidance. Productivity is personal; what you produce turns out the way it turns out because **you** made it. The process is infused in your creation, and the process is unique to you. These people out there can only promote what works for them. They don't know you, they aren't your friend, they don't even know you exist. That's not to say they are bad people, they are simply clueless

Oh boy, when I made this site I wanted to create stuff I like. I want to be like Nietzsche in *The gay science*:

> I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.” 

And yet, here I am ranting against the evil, cruel world out there. I guess I need to get a few things out of my system to make space for the good stuff. 

I suppose I proposed "looking away" as a way to get out of the loop. We're getting there. Yo, we need to drop productivity apps in order to produce something beautiful. There's your link. Got it.
